        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I do not have specific information about an institution called "SMVITM." It's possible that this institution has come into existence or gained prominence after that date. If "SMVITM" refers to a college or educational institution, I recommend checking official sources such as the institution's website, educational directories, or news articles for accurate and up-to-date information about its description, programs, faculty, campus, and other relevant details. If you can provide more context or information, I'd be happy to help you to the best of my knowledge.</p>
